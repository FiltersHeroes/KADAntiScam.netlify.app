## Action {#action class="display-6 border-bottom border-primary mb-3 text-center"}
We regularly analyse submissions from our community, but also rely on external lists created by teams such as [CERT Poland](https://cert.pl/lista-ostrzezen/), [legalniewsieci.pl](https://www.legalniewsieci.pl/aktualnosci/podejrzane-sklepy-internetowe) and [KNF](https://www.knf.gov.pl/dla_konsumenta/ostrzezenia_publiczne).

In addition to an extensive and ever-growing list of junk sites, these filters also have a list of *"redirect pages"*, making blocking even better. Every junk page found/reported is checked carefully, together with the source code, as all sorts of tricks can be found on it which, for example, hide its real address. KAD deals with this by blocking the original site as well as the *"redirecting"* one, making blocking more effective.

Although subscribing KAD along with other protection filters makes for a great whole, it doesn't in any way mean 100% protection, because there is no such thing. Remember to use common sense when browsing the web - check website addresses and read the terms and conditions of suspicious sites, especially those that offer something *"for free"*.
