      KADhosts supplement for [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).

      For proper operation, don't download it yourself, but download [Regex Hosts Installer for Pi-hole](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiltersHeroes/ScriptsPlayground/master/scripts/RLI_for_Pi-hole.py), and then run it with lists URL as its parameter, i.e. `path_to_installer/RLI_for_Pi-hole.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiltersHeroes/KADhosts/master/KADhole.txt`. Updates should also be performed similarly. You can of course add this script to cron for automatic updating from time to time.
